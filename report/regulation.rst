Result table for upstream open reading frame.

- coordinates: genomic coordinates of the potential uORF.

- gene_symbol: gene symbol of main ORF.

- start_codon: Used start codon.

- transcript_id: transcript identifier of main ORF.

- uORF_id: uniquely identifies the found uORFs for a transcript by appending an index to the transcript id (e.g ENST00000421495.6.1).

- mean_reads_uORF_c1: mean read count for uORFs in condition 1.

- mean_reads_ORF_c1: mean read count for ORFs in condition 1.

- mean_reads_uORF_c2: mean read count for uORFs in condition 2.

- mean_reads_ORF_c2: mean read count for ORFs in condition 2.

- log2FC_main_ORF_to_uORF_ratios: Ratio between the ratio of normalized ORF vs uORF for condition1 and ORF vs uORF for condition 2.
