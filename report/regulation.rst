Result table for upstream open reading frame.

- coordinates: genomic coordinates of the potential uORF.

- gene_symbol: gene symbol of main ORF.

- start_codon: Used start codon.

- transcript_id: transcript identifier of main ORF.

- uORF_id: uniquely identifies the found uORFs for a transcript by appending an index to the transcript id (e.g ENST00000421495.6.1).

- ribo_change: Ratio between the ratio of normalized ORF vs uORF for condition1 and ORF vs uORF for condition 2.

- direction: describes potential regulation of main ORF by uORF by association of their change of translational efficiency.

  - (+) up: Main ORF is upregulated vs uORF between condititon 1 and 2.
  
  - (-) down: Main ORF is downrelated in comparison to uORF between condition 1 and 2.
